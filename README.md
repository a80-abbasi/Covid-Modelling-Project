# Covid-Modelling-Project
Classifying chest X-ray images into 3 class of covid, pneumonia, and normal classes on [kaggle's radiography dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) and about 570 covid images gathered in iran (and more to be added soon).  
We use lung segmentation in order to remove marks and notes on the sides of images.
